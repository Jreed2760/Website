  	<p>AntiBrawl was devised by a group of ambitious college students for a class project. From the brain of Kevin Guzman and with the help of Akai Beza, Justo Rodriguez and Jerome Reedy, AntiBrawl was born. Jerome is the project manager and sound designer. Justo is the lead programmer. Akai is the narrative designer and Kevin is a 3D modeler. Each person, through their own twisted sense of humor, brought great strengths to the project.
