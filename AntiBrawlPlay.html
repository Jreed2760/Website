<p>Controls ON PC: Players move using the WASD/IJKL/Arrow keys to move. Spacebar is to use items. <br><br>



Gameplay: Anti Brawl is featured inside a small sized arena. Players each take the control of a voodoo doll, representing their respective character through color. The arena features several kinds of traps such as trap doors and hidden spikes. In later iterations, we hope to add things such as moveable platforms, objects that can be set up to trap players and various other mechanics to make the objective more creative to obtain.<br> <br>

Players will also have the benefit of items. Vials of medicine/poison will spawn around the arena and players can either give these vials to an opponent to heal them or drink the vial to harm themselves. These will last over periods of time. Pillows will also be available to players in order to prevent an opponent from taking damage or to suffocate themselves.

We aimed to give items a dual purpose in order to give players more options. It could be advantageous to sabotage an opponent and slow them down.

During the games start, players are immediately thrown into the game and must start to figure out ways to meet their objective. Through the environment of the arena, players can devise creative plans to cause harm to themselves. The discovery of hidden spikes and trap doors will only add to the players arsenals. Upon taking damage, players HP will be reduced and when that HP meter hits 0, players die, successfully achieving their objective.

If a match has gone on for too long, an incredibly powerful, magical artifact will spawn and the game then becomes more of a race to the artifact. The magical artifact changes depending on the stage but still functions the very same throughout. Each item is designed to instantly destroy the person who touches it. This gives the game a more fast paced feeling because now the there is more pressure on the players in order to get to the artifact  first.

The main level of Anti Brawl takes place in the house of C’thal a voodoo goddess who is looking for a successor. The level features things such as candles, dim lighting, cobwebs, voodoo artifacts such as skulls, sinister looking symbols and glyphs, and an eerie mist fills the house.

Players are playing as small, brown voodoo dolls and each player is distinguished by the colors of their voodoo doll’s stiching. The colors players are featured as are red, blue, green and yellow. The aesthetics of the voodoo dolls or the selection of the players characters have no impact on gameplay and are for story telling purposes only.
